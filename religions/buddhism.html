                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Buddhism, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE in what is now Nepal and India, is a major world religion that focuses on personal spiritual development and the attainment of enlightenment. It emphasizes the impermanence of life, the suffering inherent in existence, and the path to liberation from suffering.</p>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Siddhartha Gautama was a prince who renounced his royal life to seek the truth about suffering. After years of meditation and ascetic practices, he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya. He spent the rest of his life teaching the Dharma, the path to enlightenment. Buddhism spread across Asia, evolving into various traditions such as Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.</p>
