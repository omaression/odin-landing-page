                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Hinduism, one of the oldest religions in the world, originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is a complex and diverse religion without a single founder or central religious authority. Hinduism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, united by concepts such as Dharma, Karma, and Moksha.</p>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Hinduism's roots trace back to the ancient Indus Valley civilization (c. 2500-1500 BCE) and the subsequent Vedic period. The Vedas, composed during this time, form the foundation of Hindu religious thought. Over millennia, Hinduism has evolved, absorbing and assimilating various cultural and religious influences.</p>
