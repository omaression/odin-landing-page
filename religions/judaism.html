                <p>Judaism, one of the oldest monotheistic religions, originated in the Middle East over 3,000 years ago. It is centered on the covenant between God and the people of Israel and emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior, social justice, and the observance of religious laws.</p>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Judaism traces its roots to the patriarch Abraham, who is considered the founding figure. The religion further developed through the covenant established with Moses at Mount Sinai, where the Torah, including the Ten Commandments, was given. Jewish history is marked by periods of enslavement, exile, and diaspora, as well as cultural and religious flourishing.</p>
