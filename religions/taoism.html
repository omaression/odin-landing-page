                <p>Taoism (Daoism) is a philosophical and religious tradition that originated in China over 2,000 years ago. It emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the Way), which is the fundamental principle that is the source of everything in the universe.</p>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Taoism traces its origins to Laozi, a semi-legendary figure credited with writing the foundational text, the Tao Te Ching. Another key figure is Zhuangzi, whose writings further developed Taoist philosophy. Taoism evolved into both a philosophical school and a religious movement with rituals, temples, and clergy.</p>
