                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Christianity is one of the world's major religions, centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. It emerged in the 1st century CE in the region of Judea, part of the Roman Empire, and has since spread globally, becoming the largest religion in the world with over 2 billion adherents.</p>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Christianity began as a sect within Judaism, with Jesus of Nazareth as its central figure. Jesus' teachings and his proclamation of the Kingdom of God attracted a following. After his crucifixion under Roman governance, his followers believed he was resurrected from the dead, a cornerstone of Christian faith. The apostles, particularly Peter and Paul, played crucial roles in spreading Christianity beyond Jewish communities, reaching the Gentile (non-Jewish) populations across the Roman Empire.</p>

                <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>The Holy Trinity:</span>Christianity professes belief in one God in three persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. This doctrine is encapsulated in the Nicene Creed.</li>
                    <li><span>Salvation through Jesus Christ:</span>Christians believe that through Jesus' death and resurrection, humanity is offered salvation and eternal life. This belief is based on Jesus' sacrifice as atonement for sin.</li>
                    <li><span>The Bible:</span>The Bible, composed of the Old and New Testaments, is the sacred scripture. The Old Testament shares texts with Judaism, while the New Testament contains writings about Jesus’ life, the early church, and teachings of the apostles.</li>

                    <li><span>Love and Compassion:</span>Jesus emphasized love for God and love for one’s neighbor as the greatest commandments. This is often summarized in the Great Commandment: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" (Matthew 22:37-39).</li>
                    <li><span>The Beatitudes:</span> In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus presented the Beatitudes, which are blessings pronounced on those who exhibit certain virtues and suffer for righteousness’ sake (Matthew 5:3-12).</li>
                    <li><span>Forgiveness and Repentance:</span> Jesus taught the importance of forgiving others and repenting for one's sins to reconcile with God. "If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you." (Matthew 6:14).</li>
