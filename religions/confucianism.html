                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Confucius was a teacher and philosopher who sought to restore order and morality during a time of social chaos in China. His teachings were compiled by his disciples in texts such as the Analects. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of family, respect for elders, and reverence for ancestors.
