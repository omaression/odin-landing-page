                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Islam began in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad received revelations from Allah (God) through the angel Gabriel over 23 years. These revelations were later compiled into the Quran, Islam’s holy book. Muhammad's migration (Hijra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. After Muhammad's death, the Muslim community rapidly expanded under the leadership of the caliphs, spreading Islam across the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond.</p>
